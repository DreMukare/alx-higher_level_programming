# alx-higher_level_programming

*INTRODUCTION*

Entering the exciting world of High Level Programming, where we experience strong
 abstraction hence shorter programs. What's even more exciting is the use of an
 interpretor.

 This repository contains programs written in Python, C and Shell.

*PROJECTS*

## 1. 0x00-python-hello_world

Getting started with Python. Formating output and string manipulation.

## 2. 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions

Loops and flow control using if...else. Functions in python are also introduced here.

## 3. 0x02-python-import_modules

Python modules enhance code reusability. This project explains how modules are created and used to write python scripts.

## 4. 0x03-python-data_structures

Python supports a number of data structures. These include lists, stacks queues, tuples.

## 5. 0x04-python-more_data_structures

More data structures in python are sets and dictionaries. In built function introduced here include map, filter, lambda anonymous functions.

## 6. 0x05-python-exceptions

An exception is an error detected during execution. Python offers a variety of builtin exceptions and also allows for custom exceptions.

## 7. 0x06-python_classes

Object Oriented Programming is a way of organizing a program such that the data and functionality are put together to make an object. 
An object is an instance of a class whereby the class defines the layout of te object in terms of the attributes and methods.
Python like any other OOP Language, supports the four main concepts of OOP. These are: Data Encapsulation, Data Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism.

## 8. 0x07-python-test_driven_development

Test driven development involves coming up with tests for a certain program before writing the actual program. Pyhtonn has made this possible through the *doctest* module. 
The *doctest* module searches or pieces of text that lok like interactive Pythonn sessions and then executes those sessions to verify tay work exactly as shown. 

## 9. 0x08-python-more_classes

More class example tasks in Python.

## 10. 0x09-python-everything_is_object

Python works differently with different types of objects. It is necessary to understand the reason why this is so.

## 11. 0x0A-python-inheritance

Just like any other object oriented programming language, Python also has class inheritance.
